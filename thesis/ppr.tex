\section{Ranking Using Local and Global Graph Structure}

% https://cs.stanford.edu/people/plofgren/bidirectional_ppr_thesis.pdf

In this chapter we explore a variety of ways of measuring relative intensities of adjectives with respect the to the PPDB graph. First, we explore the possiblity of ranking adjectives based only on local comparisons found in corpus and the PPDB graph. Next we consider incorporating the using local connectivity heuristic of adjectives in cases where no direct edges are observed. Finally, we generalize this heuristic by comparing the personalized page rank of adjectives with respect to each other.
